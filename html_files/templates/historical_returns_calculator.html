                <h1> Historical returns calculator </h1>
                <p> The goal of this calculator is to show what your approximate return from purchasing various investments would be. This 
                calculator relies on a <a href = "https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html"> dataset  </a> compiled by the NYU stern school of business. </p>
                
                What is an index fund?
                Index funds are combinations of stocks which track certain economical indexes. The S&P 500 index tracks the
                prices of the stocks from the top 500 stocks in the United States over time. There are many index funds which track the price
                of the S&P index fund.  </p>
               
                <p> Below are definitions for the various investment indices you can select from below.</p>
                
                <p>
                S&P 500-Represents the stock prices of top 50 stocks in the United States

                These indices are meant to represent the average return from different investment vehicles. Index funds are combinations of stocks whose
                price tracks the value of the index. These index funds have become increasingly popular in recent years, as the combinations of stocks
                serves to mitigate risk from individual companies. However, index funds typically charge a fee for running the fund. Passively managed index funds which
                track the price of an index typically have lower fees than actively managed mutual funds where an investment management fee makes decisions about the purchases
                and sales of individual stocks in the fund. The function below allows you to select different index funds and show how these investments fared over the last 40 years, including fees.

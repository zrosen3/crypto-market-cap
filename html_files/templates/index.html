<h1> Personal investment calculators </h1>
<p> "Just come out to dinnner tonight!" my friend implored me. No, if I save the $30 that can make me a lot money later on.
How much money would that $30 be in 10 years, or 30 years? This page was designed to help answer such unknowable questions. Even though
stock performance is not entirely predictable, this page gives helpful approximations for how much investments increase in value over time.</p>
<p>
This website contains a series of investment calculators designed to show you the long term impact of various investment decisions. 
The calculators build on one another and are intended to be reviewed from top to bottom, but you can review them in any order you choose.

        <h1> Real investment returns calculator </h1>
       <p> So far, we have been assuming no inflation. Inflation is the amount which goods become more expensive over time. 
            The government typically uses a variation of CPI, or consumer price index, to track inflation. To calculate CPI,
            the government takes a set basket of goods and monitors the change in historical pricing. Inflation detracts from 
            the value stockholders gain from the accumulation in stock price. For example, if a stock increases in value 10%,
            but inflation is 2%, the value of the stock increased by 8%. The real interest rate is the stock's true appreciation
            in value over time, and is calculated here as the nominal interest rate minus inflation. The federal bank of
            the US aims to keep inflation around 2% a year, though inflation has been much higher than 2% in recent times.</p>
